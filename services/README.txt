This directory contains all kinds of services, that are either:

* used by daisy, but also reusable outside the context of daisy

* provide additional (optional) functionality (extensions) for daisy

Maintaining these as separate artifacts helps keeping an overview of
the code, keeps dependencies and interfaces clean, and makes code
reusable outside the core of daisy.
