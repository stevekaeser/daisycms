This directory contains the "publisher". This is an optional component
that can be deployed in the daisy repository server.

Its purpose is to assemble all the information needed to publish the page
into one big XML, so that this information can be retrieved from the
repository server in one remote call. In other words, it's existence
is mainly out of performance considerations.
