The query model.

<p>The query model should be stateless for expression evaluation, but
is not stateless for SQL generation.

<p>That is, if expressions are precompiled they can be evaluated multiple
times, by multiple threads concurrently (for example, this is used
for evaluating the ACL expressions).

<p>The SQL generation is however not threadsafe, as sometimes state
needs to be kept between the 'generate sql' and 'bind sql' phases.
(This could of course be changed to retain that state in some
context object, but this is how the situation currently is).
