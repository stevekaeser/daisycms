<!--
   Generates the document editor fields form by aggregating the templates
   of the individual field editors.

   Caching is very important here (see the jx:cache-key en cache-validity),
   otherwise this template and each of the field templates need to be
   regenerated on each request, possibly causing many pipelines, XSLs,
   etc. to be executed.
