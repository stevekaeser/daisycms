Simple value-objects representing Daisy repository schema types.

Upon import and export, the schema is first constructed using these objects,
and then serialized to XML (for export) or applied to the repository (on import).

The advantage of this approach is that it allows to easily modify the schema types
(e.g. add or remove fields, ...) on import or export.
